			 <p>A big part of me loves the fact that there&rsquo;s engineering folks at JPL writing software patches for 1977 technology on the Voyager probes:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-team-focuses-on-software-patch-thrusters">www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa&hellip;</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to learn more details on the tech, how the code it.. they must have been updating the process a lot since 1977.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll happy drive up to JPL to visit and learn if anyone runs into this post. :)</p>

			 <p>Almost every year where I watch the WWDC keynote virtually I’d have twitter / Mastodon up, following along with peoples thoughts and reactions in real-ish time. But not really focusing on the presentation itself.</p>

<p>This year I’m going to do something different. I’m traveling to Cupertino to be with my coworkers, and I’ll be closing my laptop and just be with them and the presentation.</p>

<p>I’ve also found myself, when bored, turning to Reddit / Twitter / Mastodon. I’m going to set up One Sec to prevent that, and hopefully break me of that habit this week. I already feel like it’s going to be tough. 🙂</p>

			 <p>Some nice neighbors are changing part of their garage into a gym, and said I could buy their metal shelves at a discount.</p>

<p>Of course that means I need to start cleaning up my garage. 🙃 Nope, not posting a picture. Yet. 😀</p>

			 <p>Today at work was &ldquo;Focus Friday&rdquo; - and I called it &ldquo;bug fix Friday&rsquo; - I spent the day fixing some bugs that had been annoying me and other people, and then added a small feature I&rsquo;ve been wanting for a while.. (command + / - to increase / decrease font sizes in the app).  It was a great day!</p>
