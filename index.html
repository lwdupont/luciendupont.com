			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t been minding Liquid Glass on the iPhone and iPad&hellip; ya, the animations are a little distracting, but fun.</p>
<p>On macOS it&rsquo;s fine. I haven&rsquo;t noticed any functionality issues..</p>
<p>But this screenshot showing my top left corner on my laptop screen has been bugging me. The rounded window corner against the square desktop just looks weird..</p>
<p>Although as I type this, I realize I have turned on the accessibility function to show the menu bar.. and just turned that off, no change.</p>
<p>And I also had reduce transparency on, turning that off helped a bit.. it&rsquo;d be nice to have dark menu bar text in dark mode.</p>

			 <p>Last night I bought Paul Hudson&rsquo;s Everything But The Code: <a href="https://twostraws.gumroad.com/l/everything-but-the-code">https://twostraws.gumroad.com/l/everything-but-the-code</a>, <em>and couldn&rsquo;t stop reading it</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really got me excited about getting back into &lsquo;indie dev&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve always been pretty good about ideas and the development part of indie dev, but never did the marketing,</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some choice quotes that really resonated with me:</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúBut we already have enough code. If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re almost certainly either shipping apps already, or you&rsquo;re about to do so in the next few months, so let&rsquo;s fast forward past the code and focus on the most important part: help you build and ship apps that are smash hits‚Äù</em></p>
<p><em>‚ÄúCode got you started. This gets you paid‚Äù</em></p>
<p>From Arthaud Mesnard: <em>‚Äúin a world where anyone can build anything, most won‚Äôt.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>So, stay tuned, subscribe to the blog at luciendupont.com, and let&rsquo;s see how this goes.</p>
<p>PS: If you want to join me, let me know! Go buy the book, and we&rsquo;ll go through it together.</p>
